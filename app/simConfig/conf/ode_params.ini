// The smaller the step the more precise the dynamic simulation.
// If the step is too little then the simulation will not run in real time (a warning message is printed).

// Constraint Force Mixing
// If CFM=0 the constraint is hard, if CFM>0 then it is possible to violate the constraint by pushing on it.
// Increasing CFM can reduce the numerical errors in the simulation, hence increasing stability.
// Default value is 1e-5 for single precision, 1e-10 for double precision.

// Maximum correcting velocity that the contacts are allowed to generate. Default value is infinity.
// Reducing it can help prevent "popping" of deeply embedded objects
maxContactCorrectingVel 1000

//Contact joints can simulate friction at the contact by applying special forces in the two friction directions that are perpendicular to the normal.
//This value sets the friction coefficient, mju, for both directions. High means that the colliding surfaces will not slide along one another.
//0.0 means that they will slip along one another with no resistance.
contactFrictionCoefficient 1.0

// Contacts are allowed to sink into the surface layer up to the given depth before coming to rest.
// The default value is zero. Increasing this to some small value (e.g. 0.001) can help prevent jittering
// problems due to contacts being repeatedly made and broken.

// Joint Stop Fudge Factor
// Value in [0, 1], default is 1.

// If it is too small it can prevent the motor from being able to move the joint away from the limit.
