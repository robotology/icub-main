// Maximum correcting velocity that the contacts are allowed to generate. Default value is infinity.
// Reducing it can help prevent "popping" of deeply embedded objects

//Contact joints can simulate friction at the contact by applying special forces in the two friction directions that are perpendicular to the normal.
//This value sets the friction coefficient, mju, for both directions. High means that the colliding surfaces will not slide along one another. 
//0.0 means that they will slip along one another with no resistance.

// Contacts are allowed to sink into the surface layer up to the given depth before coming to rest. 
// The default value is zero. Increasing this to some small value (e.g. 0.001) can help prevent jittering 
// problems due to contacts being repeatedly made and broken.
