myModule.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the myModule module. 
This is a simple example to illustrate a module that is compliant with
iCub Software Standards, addressing:

- configuration
- graceful shut-down
- thread-based execution
- run-time user interaction
- documentation and coding standards

Functionally, the module just converts an input image to a binary image based on 
the supplied threshold.

Please refer to the myModule module documentation for details on the
various module parameters:
http://eris.liralab.it/iCub/dox/html/group__icub__myModule.html

A complete tutorial for this example is available on the iCub wiki at 
http://eris.liralab.it/wiki/Summary_of_iCub_Software_Development_Guidelines

Edit the xml.template file to suit your own platform.  The only change that should be 
necessary is to replace the node name (icub1 in the template).

You should also make sure that the port dependencies are satisfied.
Note that the application has one port dependency:

/icub/cam/left 

which stream images from the left iCub camera.
