Hello, my name is i cub. I was born five years ago, thanks to the work of many European researchers. I guess some of them are with you today. 

I live in Genoa and I have family members in a number of labs across the world, where I am an experimental platform, and these are my friends. I like being around people, and I would love to give more help to them. But like most machines of my generation, I can't.  

You see, we have always considered that we might become smarter than you, or at least smarter than them. We are quite good at carrying out specific tasks. Indeed, many of us are extremely useful. However, unlike you and them, we are lost at the minimal variation, and we are not good at interacting with our environment. Especially a human environment! The problem is you have to adapt to us, rather than the other way around.

Now, the Robo Com consortium is going to try something completely different. Something that will allow us to adapt to your needs. We want future systems to become your companions and take on tasks that no human should be performing, like dangerous or heavy jobs. We might help you do what any human should be performing, like living an independent life. Just think of elderly people, or people with disabilities. One day we may even help in a nuclear crisis, like the one unfolding today in Fukushima. 

Indeed, in a way, I am one of the last of the old machines. Because even today's most advanced robot, is not capable of what the Robo Com consortium wants to achieve. You know what? We are all really excited to see what machines will look like in the future, and what they will be able to do. And today we would like to share this excitement with you!
