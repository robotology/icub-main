\defgroup icub_dumpControlBoardData dumpControlboardData

This is the application used to launch different processes to dump
control board data to files (positions, velocities, accelerations,
voltages, currents, tracking errors).


\section dep_sec Dependencies
Assumes \ref icub_iCubInterface is running.

\section int_sec Instantiated Modules
- \ref icub_controlBoardDumper

- yarpdatadumper

\section parameters_sec Parameters

See below.


\section howto How to run the Application
\code
./app start: start the application, run all modules and viewers
./app connect: connect all modules and viewers (starts dumping)
./app stop: stop the application, shut down all modules
\endcode

\section config How to config the application

In case you want to personalize this dumper application you mainly need to edit the
configuration files (conf/config.sh and conf/config-nodes.sh) and single parts configuration files
(e.g. conf/icubHead.ini).
<ul>
<li> The config.sh file describes the part to be dumped (variable $PARTS_TO_DUMP).
<li> The config-nodes.sh file describes the machines where the single modules
(\ref icub_controlBoardDumper and yarpdatadumper) will be executed. In particular,
the $NODE_DUMPERS variable defines the machines where data will be dumped
(usally in the directory $NODE_DUMPERS:/tmp/icub/dataDumper).
<li> The icubHead.ini file is the file used by the \ref icub_controlBoardDumper to
dump the head joints (see similar files for the other robot parts). This file
can be used to define the joints to be dumped, the sampling time and the type
of data to be dumped (see the \ref icub_controlBoardDumper details).
</ul>
