\defgroup icub_faceExpressions faceExpressions

Start the face expression.

\section intro_sec Description

Contains scripts to run the face expressions. At the moment only runs locally.

\section dep_sec Dependencies
None.

\section modules_sec Instantiated Modules
- emotionInterface
- serial device through \e yarpdev

\code
./conf/emotions.ini: parameters passed to the emotionInterface module.
./conf/serialport.ini: parameters passed to the serial device.
\endcode

\section example_sec How to run the application

Run and execute through \e gyarpmanager .

There are two applications:

- Face Expressions (app.xml). This can run out of the box, since it assumes you have a pc104 and a real iCub.

If you are using the simulator edit and customize \e appSim.xml.template .

Now from any machine you can rpc to the port "/icub/face/emotions/in"
and send high level commands.

\code
set mou <cmd>   -  set an expression in the mouth subsystem
set eli <cmd>   -  set an expression in the eye-lids subsystem
set leb <cmd>   -  set an expression in the left eyebrow subsystem
set reb <cmd>   -  set an expression in the right eyebrow subsystem
set all <cmd>   -  set an expression in the whole system
\endcode

The several <cmd> are described in file emotions.ini (see below). You can define your own.


You can also send raw commands to the low level driver.

\code
set raw S04
set raw L03
set raw R05
set raw M04
\endcode

Alternatively you can run:

\code
./cycle.sh: demonstates the face expressions, cycle randomly through a set of expressions.
\endcode
