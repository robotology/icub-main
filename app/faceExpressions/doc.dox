\tableofcontents

Start the face expression.

\section intro_sec Description

Contains scripts to run the face expressions. At the moment only runs locally.

\section dep_sec Dependencies
None.

\section modules_sec Instantiated Modules
- emotionInterface
- serial device through \e yarpdev

\code
./conf/emotions.ini: parameters passed to the emotionInterface module to run expressions on "classic" iCub.
./conf/emotions_rfe.ini: parameters passed to the emotionInterface module to run expressions on iCub mounting the rfe board.
./conf/serialport.ini: parameters passed to the serial device.
\endcode

\section howto_sec How to run the application

Run and execute through \e yarpmanager .

There are two applications:

- Face Expressions (faceExpressions.xml). This can run out of the box, since it assumes you have a pc104 and a real iCub.
- FaceSim (faceExpressionsSim.xml). This is the equivalent application to be used with the <a href="http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Simulator_README#FACE_EXPRESSIONS:">robot simulator</a>.

Now from any machine you can rpc to the port "/icub/face/emotions/in" and send high level commands.
Be aware that some commands are only available on the latest robots mounting the RFE board.

\code
help         to display this message

set <part> <emotion>  set a specific emotion for a defined part
        the available parts are: mou, eli, leb, reb, all
        the available emotions are: neu, hap, sad, sur, ang, evi, shy, cun

set col <color>     set the color of the led
        !! available only for rfe board !!
        the available colors are: black, white, red, lime, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, silver, gray, maroon, olive, green, purple, teal, navy

set brig <brig>       set the brightness of the leds
        !! available only for rfe board !!
        the brightness is defined by an integer from 0 to 5, where 0 means led off

set mask (<col_leb> <m_name_leb> <brig_leb>) (<col_reb> <m_name_reb> <brig_reb>) (<col_mou> <m_name_mou> <brig_mou>) set color, bitmask and brightness for each part(leb, reb, mou)
        !! available only for rfe board !!
        m_name stands for mask name and the available bitmasks can be consulted/added in faceExpressions/emotions_rfe.ini

\endcode

In particular the bitmask supported are defined in the emotions_rfe.ini file as follow:

\code
bitmask_eyebrow_emotions 4
BM_EB0 (0 4 8 12 16)  //00011111h // surprised
BM_EB1 (1 5 9 13 17)  //00022222h // neutral, happy, shy
BM_EB2 (2 6 10 14 18) //00044444h // sad
BM_EB3 (3 7 11 15 19) //00044444h // angry

bitmask_mouth_emotions 5
BM_M0  (6 9 10 18)                     //00020300h // neutral
BM_M1  (0 2 6 9 10 12 14 18)           //00045645h // happy, evil
BM_M2  (4 5 6 9 10 16 17 18)           //00070670h // sad
BM_M3  (1 2 3 5 7 8 11 13 14 15 17 19) //000AE9AEh // surprised
BM_M4  (4 5 6 9 10 16 17 18)           //00070670h // angry
\endcode

For example (6 9 10 18) means specify which that led 6, 9, 10 and 18 has to be set to on of that specific segment.
The LEDs on the iCub face mounting the rfe board are arranged as follow:
\warning Note that the enumeration is 1-based in the image but the bitmasks are 0-based

\section example_sec Example scripts

Alternatively, you can run the following bash scripts:

\code
./cycle.sh: demonstates the face expressions, cycle randomly through a set of expressions.
./exampleTransition.sh: demonstrate color/brightness transitions supported by the rfe board.
\endcode
