 *  
 * @ingroup iKin 
 *
 * Classes for on-line solution of inverse kinematic of iCub 
 * limbs based on <a 
 * href="http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Installing_IPOPT">IpOpt</a>.
 * The solvers run as on-line daemons which connect to the robot 
 * to retrieve information on the current joints configuration 
 * (along with the bounds) and by requesting a desired pose with 
 * queries made through YARP ports they return the corresponding 
 * target joints. 
 *
 * The task to be solved is:
 *
 * \f[
 * \mathbf{q}=\arg\min_{\mathbf{q}\in R^{n} }\left(\left\|\mathbf{\alpha}_d-\mathit{K_{\alpha}}\left(\mathbf{q}\right)\right\|^2+\mathit{w}\cdot\left(\mathbf{q}_r-\mathbf{q}\right)^{\top}\mathit{W}_r\left(\mathbf{q}_r-\mathbf{q}\right)\right) \quad s.t.\,\left\{\begin{array}{l}\left\|\mathbf{x}_d-\mathit{K_x}\left(\mathbf{q}\right)\right\|^2<\epsilon\\\mathbf{q}_L<\mathbf{q}<\mathbf{q}_U\end{array}\right.
 * \f]
 *
 * Where the solution \f$ \mathbf{q} \f$ is the joints vector with n components (depending
 * on the task and the current dof configuration) that is guaranteed to be found within the physical 
 * bounds expressed by \f$ \mathbf{q}_L \f$ and \f$ \mathbf{q}_U \f$; \f$ \mathbf{x}_d\equiv\left(x,y,d\right)_d \f$
 * is the positional part of the desired pose, \f$ \mathbf{\alpha}_d \f$ is the
 * desired orientation and \f$ \mathit{K_x} \f$ and \f$ \mathit{K_{\alpha}} \f$ are
 * the forward kinematic maps for the position and orientation part, respectively;
 * \f$ \mathbf{q}_r \f$ is used to keep the solution as close as possible to a given rest
 * position in the joint space (weighting with a positive factor \f$ \mathit{w} < 1 \f$ and also
 * through the diagonal matrix \f$ \mathit{W}_r \f$ which allows to select a specific weight for each joint)
 * and \f$ \epsilon \f$ is a small number in the range of \f$ \left[10^{-5},10^{-4}\right] \f$.
 *  
 * \section protocol_sec Solver protocol
 *  
 * Once created the solver will open three ports with which user 
 * can communicate and exchange information according to the 
 * following rules: 
 *  
 * <b> /<solverName>/in </b> accepts a properties-like bottle 
 *    containing the following requests in streaming mode:
 *  
 * \b xd request: example ([xd] (x y z ax ay az theta)), 
 *    specifies the target pose to be achieved as a 7-components
 *    vector for position and orientation parts. Note that if
 *    the current pose is of [xyz] type, then only the first
 *    3-components are meaningful (x,...,az are in meters, theta
 *    is in radians).
 *  
 * \b pose request: example ([pose] [full]), specifies the 
 *    end-effector pose the user wants to achieve; it can be
 *    [full] (position+orientation) or [xyz] (only position).
 *  
 * \b mode request: example ([mode] [cont]), selects the solver 
 *    mode between [cont] which implements a continuous tracking
 *    and [shot] which does not compensate for movements induced
 *    on unacatuated joints. Indeed, in continuous mode the
 *    solver yields a new solution whenever a detected movements
 *    on uncontrolled links determines a displacement from the
 *    desired target.
 *  
 * \b dof request: example ([dof] (1 1 0 1 ...)), specifies 
 *    which dof of the chain are actuated (by putting 1 in the
 *    corresponding position) and which not (with 0). The length
 *    of the provided list of 1's and 0's should match the
 *    number of chain's dof. The special value 2 is used to keep
 *    the link status unchanged and proceed to the next link.
 *  
 * \b resp request: example ([resp] (20.0 0.0 0.0 ...)), 
 *    specifies for each joint the rest position in degrees. The
 *    reply will contain the rest position resulting from the
 *    application of joints limits.
 *  
 * \b resw request: example ([resw] (1.0 0.0 1.0 ...)), 
 *    specifies for each joint the weight used to compute the
 *    rest position minimization task. The reply will contain
 *    the weights as result of a saturation over zero.
 *  
 * \b tok synchro: a double may be added to the request which 
 *    will be in turn sent back by the solver for
 *    synchronization purpose.
 *  
 * \note One single command sent to the streaming input port can
 *       contain multiple requests: e.g. ([pose] [xyz]) ([dof]
 *       (1 0 1 2 1)) ([xd] (-0.1 0.1 0.1) ([tok] 1.234) ...)
 *  
 * \note Remind that the intended use of this port is in 
 *       streaming mode, thus it might happen that one request
 *       is dropped in favour of the most recent one. Therefore,
 *       as a general remark, rely on this port for xd requests
 *       and use rpc for dof, mode, pose, ... requests (see
 *       below).
 *
 *  
 * <b> /<solverName>/rpc </b> accepts a vocab-like bottle 
 *    containing the following requests, executes them and
 *    replies with [ack]/[nack] and/or some useful info:
 *  
 * Commands issued through [set]/[get] vocab: 
 *  
 * \b pose request: example [set] [pose] [full]/[xyz], [get] 
 *    [pose].
 *  
 * \b pose priority request: example [set] [prio] [xyz]/[ang], 
 *    [get] [prio]. For example, setting priority to [ang]
 *    allows considering the reaching in orientation as a
 *    constraint while reaching in position is handled as an
 *    objective.
 *  
 * \b mode request: example [set] [mode] [cont]/[shot], [get] 
 *    [mode].
 *  
 * \b lim request: example [set] [lim] axis min max, [get] [lim]
 *    axis. Set/return minimum and maximum values for the joint.
 *    Allowed range shall be a valid subset of the real control
 *    limits (unit is deg).
 *  
 * \b verbosity request: example [set] [verb] [on]/[off], [get] 
 *    [verb].
 *  
 * \b dof request: example [set] [dof] (1 2 1 0 ...), [get] 
 *    [dof]. The reply will contain the current dof as result of
 *    the reconfiguration. The result may differ from the
 *    request since on certain limb (e.g. arm) some links are
 *    considered to form a unique super-link (e.g. the shoulder)
 *    whose components cannot be actuated separately.
 *  
 * \b resp request: example [set] [resp] (20.0 0.0 0.0 ...), 
 *    [get] [resp]. Set/get for each joint the rest position in
 *    degrees. The reply will contain the rest position
 *    resulting from the application of joints limits (lim
 *    request does affect the range).
 *  
 * \b resw request: example [set] [resw] (1.0 0.0 1.0 ...), 
 *    [get] [resw]. Set/get for each joint the weight used to
 *    compute the rest position minimization task. The reply
 *    will contain the weights as result of a saturation over
 *    zero.
 *  
 * \b tsk2 request: example [set] [tsk2] (6 (0.0 0.0 -1.0) (0.0 
 *    0.0 1.0), [get] [tsk2]. Set/get the options for the
 *    secondary task, where the first integer accounts for the
 *    joints to control, then come the desired x-y-z coordinates
 *    of the secondary end-effector and finally the
 *    corresponding three weights.
 *  
 * \b conv request: example [set] [conv] ((max_iter 200) (tol 
 *    0.001) (translationalTol 0.000001)), [get] [conv]. Set/get
 *    the options for specifying solver's convergence.
 *  
 * Commands issued through the [ask] vocab: 
 *  
 * \b xd request: example [ask] ([xd] (x y z ax ay az theta))
 *    ([pose] [xyz]) ([q] (...)). Ask to solve for the target
 *    xd. User can specifies a different starting joint
 *    configuration q and the pose mode. The reply will contain
 *    something like [ack] ([q] (...)) ([x] (...)), where the
 *    found configuration q is returned as well as the final
 *    attained pose x.
 *  
 * Commands concerning the thread status: 
 *  
 * \b susp request: example [susp], suspend the thread. 
 *  
 * \b run request: example [run], let the thread run again.  
 *  
 * \b status request: example [status], returns [ack] 
 *    "not_started"|"running"|"suspended".
 *  
 * \b quit request: example [quit], close ports and quit the
 *    thread. [ack] is returned.
 *  
 * Commands concerning the solver configuration: 
 *  
 * \b cfg request: example [cfg] (robot icub) (type left) (pose
 *    full) (tol 1e-3) (maxIter 150) ... Once instantiated the
 *    solver is not automatically configured. To do that user
 *    can call the open() method locally or can configure the
 *    solver remotely by sending to the rpc port the
 *    configuration properties. For a list of these properties
 *    please see the documentation of open() method.
 *  
 *  
 * <b> /<solverName>/out </b> streams out a bottle containing 
 *    the result of optimization instance. The format is ([xd]
 *    (...)) ([x] (...)) ([q] (...) ([tok] ...)) as following:
 *  
 * \b xd property: contains the desired cartesian pose to be 
 *    achieved (7-components vector).
 *  
 * \b x property: contains the real cartesian pose achieved 
 *    which in norm is the nearest one to xd (7-components
 *    vector).
 *  
 * \b q property: contains the joints configuration which 
 *    achieves x (DOF-components vector in degrees).
 *  
 * \b tok property: contains the token that the client may have 
 *    added to the request.
 *  
 * Date: first release 20/06/2009
