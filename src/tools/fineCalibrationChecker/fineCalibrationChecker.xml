    This module is a tool for checking the accuracy of joint calibration.
    Specifically it aims at reading the raw position of the joint encoder and comparing it with the expected <i>golden</i> position, 
    which is the one that the joint should have when we are sure about its mechanics and calibration, i.e. it ground truth.
    
    In order to use this module, whose final target is to print the needed position data to a csv file and then plot it on a GUI, you need to have the following:
    <list>
      <item>
        <description>supposed to have the correct setup running and the yarprobotinterface open</description>
      </item>
      <item>
        <description>fineCalibrationChecker --from config.ini</description>
      </item>
    </list>
    This will instantiate a module and a thread that will run at a specific period. The core od this thread is running some actiions. 
    Once those are done and the user has got all the data the module can be simply closed. In this moment the thread will stop and the module will close.
