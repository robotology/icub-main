  * \page copyright_and_license Copyright and license

The standards for iCub copyright and licensing are given in
<a href="http://www.robotcub.org/index.php/robotcub/more_information/deliverables/deliverable_8_2_pdf">deliverable 8.2</a>.

All source files in the iCub repository should give a copyright
notice and license information. The recommended language is:
\verbatim
/*
 * Copyright (C) <year> RobotCub Consortium, European Commission FP6 Project IST-004370
 * Author <name of author>
 * email:   <firstname.secondname>@robotcub.org
 * website: www.robotcub.org
 * Permission is granted to copy, distribute, and/or modify this program
 * under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or any
 * later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
 *
 * A copy of the license can be found at
 * http://www.robotcub.org/icub/license/gpl.txt
 *
 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
 * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
 * Public License for more details

\endverbatim

If you have code for which you are not the copyright holder, but which
is redistributable under terms that are compatible with the GPL, you
may want to include it in the iCub repository.  It is not clear
whether this is permitted.  I describe here the procedure used
in YARP (as opposed to iCub) for such code.  This does not imply
the existence of a policy about such code for iCub.
The absolute minimum that would need to be present in each source file is:
 - A copyright statement with author name and year.  Don't forget the year.
 - A license statement that is compatible with the GPL.

For YARP, the form of these statements was at a minimum:
\verbatim
/*
 * Copyright (C) 2007 Author McAuthor
 * CopyPolicy: Released under the terms of <the license name>
 */
\endverbatim
The CopyPolicy line is useful to add for semi-automated license reviews of
material in the repository.
