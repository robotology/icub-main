iCub 1.10.0 (UNRELEASED)  Release Notes
========================

New Features
------------

### Libraries

#### `skinDynLib`
Add `linkName` and `frameName` attributes to `iCub::skinDynLib::dynContact` and `iCub::skinDynLib::skinContact`, to simplify 
interfacing with software in which link and frames are identified by names, such as software that load the robot description
from file formats like URDF and SDF. This attributes have been also added to the on-wire representation of this class, creating 
an incompatibility between versions of iCub before 1.8 and version after 1.10 , meaning that a module compiled with iCub 1.8 will
not be able to communicate with a module compiled with iCub 1.10 . Recompiling all your software with iCub 1.10 (without any modification 
to the source code) should be sufficient to ensure that everything works fine.
