  * \page compile_status Compile status

On our dashboard you can monitor the status of the compilation for YARP and the iCub software:

 - <a href="http://dashboard.icub.org/">The iCub dashboard</A>

Tests are performed:
 - Every hour, only after new commits (Continuous builds).
 - Every night, full checkout and build (Nightly builds).

Tests report compilation errors and warnings. Close to the name of each machine you find the configuration of
the machine (environment variables, installed packages).

Failure to compile can be for a very trivial reasons, and is
not necessarily a reflection of code quality.

Some tips for developers:

 - The Linux compile often catches problems with uppercase/lowercase
   that don't show up on Windows.  For example, you need to use
   FIND_LIBRARY(OpenCV) rather than FIND_LIBRARY(OPENCV).
   And you'll need to capitalize your include files consistently.

 - Different  compilers catch different errors, if something compiles on
   Visual Studio does not mean it will compile on gcc (or the other way around).
   Also, remember that newer compilers might be stricter than old ones.

 - The current list of packages you can rely on. See the Dependencies chapter
   of the manual to see the official list of dependencies.

 - Once again don't forget environment variables. See the manual for more informations
   on this.
