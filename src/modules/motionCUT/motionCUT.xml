      The module exploits the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm to detect
      independent moving points over a selectable grid of nodes. The algorithm
      is designed in such a way that it works also - and especially - with
      moving cameras.

      \note The name motionCUT stands for <i>motion Cover/Uncover
      Trick</i> and refers to its working principle that is
      detailed in the paper: Ciliberto C., Pattacini U., Natale
      L., Nori F. and Metta G., "Reexamining Lucas-Kanade Method
      for Real-Time Independent Motion Detection:
      Application to the iCub Humanoid Robot", <i>IEEE/RSJ
      International Conference on Intelligent Robots and
      Systems</i>, San Francisco, CA, USA, 2011.

      \note <b>If you're going to use the motionCUT for your work,
      please quote it within any resulting publication</b>.

      \note We warmly suggest to use OpenCV in conjunction with
      multi-threading layers such as TBB in order to achieve high
      performances for motion detection. Refer to the OpenCV
      documentation for the details.

                     Usually very small values, such as 0.5%, have to be used. Indicatively, a value of 0.5% means that the two
                     templates for the matching must have a similarity measure of 99.5% to prevent the relative node from being
                     recognized as independent moving node. Importantly, this parameter is also significantly affected by how well
                     the matching is performed; as result, for increasing OpenCV versions, the threshold needs to be reduced (e.g. 0.01%)." default=""> recogThres </param>
