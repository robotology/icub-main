@ingroup icub_module
\defgroup icub_skinManager skinManager

This module reads the raw tactile sensor values, compensates for the (thermal) drift of the sensors (basically it is a high pass filter)
and writes the compensated values on output ports.
The module can manage many input ports at the same time (see parameter "inputPorts").
For each input port the compensated tactile data are written on the corresponding output port (see parameter "outputPorts").
Optionally, the module also can apply a smoothing filter (low pass filter) and/or a binarization filter to the data.
The \ref icub_skinManagerGui can be used to control and monitor an instance of the skinManager module.
If the 3d position of the tactile sensors is provided, then this module computes the skinContacts (see library skinDynLib),
 which can be used by \ref wholeBodyDynamics to compute the contact forces.

\section intro_sec Description
When launched the module executes the skin sensor calibration, assuming that the sensors are not in contact
with anything during this phase.
The calibration resets the taxel baselines, gathers the sensor data for 5 sec, computes the mean (i.e. the baseline)
and the 95 percentile (i.e. the touch threshold) for every taxel.

After the calibration the module starts reading the raw data, computing the difference between the read values
and the baseline, and outputs the results.
If no touch is detected (i.e. the compensated values are under the touch threshold) then the baseline is updated
in order to follow the drift (if any).

The binarization filter is really simple.
Every taxel has a touch threshold, given by its 95% percentile plus a safety threshold (2 by default).
If the read value is greater than the corrisponding touch threshold the output is set to 100, otherwise to 0.
The binarization filter can be used for stressing the touch detection, especially in cases where the touch is very light.

The smoothing filter performs an exponential moving average in order to reduce the sensor noise.
The intensity of the filter can be tuned by setting the parameter alpha, also called "smoothing factor".
The smoothed output is a weighted average of the current input and the previous output:
y(t) = (1-alpha)*x(t) + alpha*y(t-1)

If the module is properly configured then it performs contact clustering, that is it determines how many contacts are
detected by the tactile sensors. When tactile sensors that are neighbors detect contact, they are clustered together.
When tactile sensors that are not neighbors detect contact, they are considered as independent contacts. The result of
this operation is a skinContactList (see skinDynLib) that is written on the output port "\moduleName\skin_events:o".
Tipically this port is connected to an input port of the module \ref wholeBodyDynamics which uses this data
to estimate the contact forces.

\section parameters_sec Parameters

<b>Command-line Parameters</b>

The following key-value pairs can be specified as command-line parameters by prefixing -- to the key
(e.g. --from file.ini). The value part can be changed to suit your needs; the default values are shown below.
 - \c from \c [driftCompLeft.ini] \n
   specifies the configuration file
 - \c context \c [skinGui] \n
    specifies the sub-path from \c $ICUB_ROOT/app to the configuration file
 - \c name \c [skinManager] \n
    specifies the name of the module (used to form the stem of module port names)
 - \c robot \c [icub] \n
    specifies the name of the robot (used only to distiguish the simulator and the real robot)

<b>Configuration File Parameters </b>

 The following key-value pairs can be specified as parameters in the configuration file
 (they can also be specified as command-line parameters if you so wish).
 The value part can be changed to suit your needs; the default values are shown below.
 - \c inputPorts \c [emptyList] \n
   list of the input ports from which the module has to read the tactile data.
   For each input port there has to be a corresponding output port specified in the "outputPorts" parameter.
 - \c outputPorts \c [emptyList] \n
   list of the output ports on which the module has to write the compensated tactile data.
   For each output port there has to be a corresponding input port specified in the "inputPorts" parameter.
 - \c period \c [20] \n
   period of the compensating thread expressed in ms.
 - \c minBaseline \c [3] \n
   if the baseline of one sensor (at least) reaches this value, then a warning message is sent on the info output port.
 - \c zeroUpRawData \c [false] \n
   if true the input tactile data are considered from zero up, otherwise from 255 down
 - \c binarization \c [not active]\n
   if specified the output tactile data are binarized: 0 indicates no touch, whereas 100 indicates touch
 - \c smoothFilter \c [not active]\n
   if specified the output tactile data are filtered with an exponential moving average (where alpha is the smooth factor):
    \t- y(t) = (1-alpha)*x(t) + alpha*y(t-1)
 - \c smoothFactor \c [0.5] \n
   alpha value of the smoothing filter, in [0, 1] where 0 is no smoothing at all and 1 is the max smoothing possible.
.
An optional section called SKIN_EVENTS may be specified in the configuration file.
These are the parameters of this section:
 - \c bodyParts \c [emptyList] \n
    list of the body parts corresponding to the specified inputPorts (see common.h in skinDynLib for the definition of BodyPart).
    For each input port there has to be a body part, e.g. UNKNOWN_BODY_PART, HEAD, TORSO, LEFT_ARM, RIGHT_ARM, LEFT_LEG, RIGHT_LEG.
 - \c skinParts \c [emptyList] \n
    list of the skin part corresponding to the specified inputPorts (see skinDynLib for the definition of SkinPart).
    For each input port there has to be a skin part, e.g. UNKNOWN_SKIN_PART, HAND, FOREARM, UPPER_ARM.
 - \c linkList \c [emptyList] \n
    list of the link number corresponding to the specified inputPorts.
    For each input port there has to be a link number (2: upperArm link, 4: forearm link, 6: hand link).
 - \c taxelPositionFiles [emptyList] \n
    list of the files containing the 3D positions and orientations of the tactile sensors for each input port.
    The files contains a set of parameters used for configuring the correspondent skinPart (iCub::skinDynLib::skinPart ,
    see skinDynLib for a definition of this class).
    Further, there is a group called [calibration] containing one line for each tactile sensor.
    In each line there are 6 values, the first three are the position, the last three are the orientation.
    For each input port there has to be a taxel position file (which may not exist because of
    missing calibration procedure for that skin part).
 - \c maxNeighborDist \c 0.015 \n
    maximum distance between two neighbor tactile sensors (in meters).


\section portsa_sec Ports Accessed
All the ports listed in the "inputPorts" parameter and the corresponding rpc ports.
For instance if in the "inputPorts" parameter it is specified the port
- /icub/skin/right_hand
.
then also the port
- /icub/skin/right_hand/rpc:i
.
will be accessed.


\section portsc_sec Ports Created
